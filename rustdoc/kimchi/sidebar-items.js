As a recap, alpha is a challenge sent by the verifier in PLONK, and is used to aggregate multiple constraints into a single polynomial. It is important that different constraints use different powers of alpha, as otherwise they can interact and potentially cancel one another. (The proof is in the use of the Schwartz-Zippel lemma.)
